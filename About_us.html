          <h2>FARMERS NETWORK;</h2>
          <h3>Empowering Ugandan Farmers. Feeding the Nation.</h3>
           <p>
            The Dannidash Farmers Network connects small-scale farmers across Uganda 
            to supply fresh, high-quality ingredients for our fried and local meals. 
            We work with over <strong>50</strong> farmers from regions like Luwero, Masaka, 
            and Gulu — sourcing chicken, cassava, matoke, potatoes, and vegetables.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Through fair trade and training, we help farmers earn steady income, 
            improve food quality, and practice sustainable agriculture. 
            Our network ensures that every Dannidash meal supports local livelihoods.
          </p>

           <strong>
            “When farmers thrive, communities grow, and hunger fades.”
           </strong>
      
          <p>
            Together, we have supported <strong>50+ farmers</strong>, increased household 
            income by <strong>30%</strong>, and delivered thousands of meals to families in need.
